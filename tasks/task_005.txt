# Description: Create modules for sentiment analysis and extraction of pains, desires, and language patterns from processed data.
# Details:
1. Implement multi-level sentiment classification:
   - Positive/negative/neutral classification
   - Emotional intensity scoring
   - Aspect-based sentiment analysis

2. Develop pains and desires extraction:
   - Problem statement identification patterns

   - Aspiration pattern recognition

3. Implement language pattern analysis:
   - Domain-specific terminology extraction
   - Phrase mining for common expressions
   - Jargon identification
   - Colloquial expression detection
   - Word frequency analysis

4. Create clustering and categorization of extracted insights:
   - Group similar pains/desires
   - Categorize by themes
   - Rank by frequency and intensity

5. Implement storage of analysis results in structured format.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test sentiment analysis against benchmark datasets and human-labeled samples.
2. Validate pain/desire extraction with known examples from e-commerce reviews.
3. Test language pattern analysis with domain-specific content.
4. Verify clustering accuracy by comparing automated groupings with manual ones.
5. Test end-to-end pipeline with sample data from all platforms.
6. Validate storage format allows for efficient querying and visualization.
7. Perform user testing to verify insights are meaningful and actionable.
