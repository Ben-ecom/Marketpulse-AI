# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Decodo Scraping API Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a wrapper around the Decodo Scraping API to handle data collection from multiple platforms.
# Details:
1. Create a service module to interact with the Decodo Scraping API.
2. Implement functions for making API requests with appropriate parameters:
   - `url`: Target URL to scrape
   - `headless`: Rendering mode (html or browser)
   - `geo`: Location for geo-targeting
   - `locale`: Language for the request
   - `device_type`: Type of device and browser
   - `session_id`: Session ID for reusing sessions
3. Develop error handling and retry mechanisms.
4. Create a job scheduling system using Supabase for queue management.
5. Implement logging for all API interactions.
6. Create utility functions for common scraping patterns.
7. Set up rate limiting to comply with API usage limits.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test API connectivity with simple scraping requests.
2. Verify correct parameter passing and response handling.
3. Simulate API failures to test error handling and retry logic.
4. Test job scheduling by creating and monitoring sample scraping jobs.
5. Verify logging captures all relevant information.
6. Benchmark performance with different parameter combinations.
7. Test rate limiting by simulating high-volume requests.
