# Task ID: 17
# Title: Extend PlatformInsights Component with Sentiment Analysis and Trending Topics
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add a third card to the renderRedditInsights method that visualizes sentiment analysis and trending topics from Reddit data, including progress bars for sentiment categories and chips for trending keywords.
# Details:
Enhance the existing PlatformInsights component by implementing a new visualization card for sentiment analysis and trending topics. The implementation should:

1. Add a third card to the renderRedditInsights method
2. Create a sentiment analysis section with three progress bars showing:
   - Positive sentiment percentage
   - Neutral sentiment percentage
   - Negative sentiment percentage
3. Implement a trending topics section displaying keyword chips
4. Ensure the card has a consistent design with existing cards
5. Make the component responsive across different screen sizes
6. Handle edge cases such as:
   - No data available
   - Extremely skewed sentiment data
   - Very long keyword strings
7. Implement proper data formatting and percentage calculations
8. Add appropriate tooltips for accessibility
9. Ensure the component updates correctly when new data is received

The sentiment data should be visualized using color-coded progress bars (green for positive, gray for neutral, red for negative). Trending keywords should be displayed as interactive chips that can be clicked for further filtering or information.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the functionality and visual appearance of the new card:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test renderRedditInsights renders the correct number of cards (should now be 3)
   - Test sentiment progress bars display correct percentages based on input data
   - Test trending topics chips render correctly with provided keywords
   - Test empty/null data handling displays appropriate fallback UI
   - Test extreme data cases (0% or 100% for sentiment categories)
   - Test component updates correctly when props change

2. Visual tests:
   - Verify consistent styling with other cards
   - Verify responsive behavior on different screen sizes
   - Verify accessibility features work correctly

3. Integration tests:
   - Verify the component integrates correctly with the data source
   - Verify interactions between the new card and existing functionality

Create test fixtures with various data scenarios to thoroughly validate all aspects of the implementation.
