# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement NLP Processing Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the natural language processing pipeline for analyzing and extracting insights from scraped data.
# Details:
1. Implement text normalization and cleaning functions:
   - Remove HTML tags, special characters, and irrelevant content
   - Handle Unicode and encoding issues
   - Normalize text case and spacing

2. Implement language detection and translation where necessary.

3. Create tokenization and lemmatization pipeline:
   - Split text into tokens
   - Reduce words to their base forms
   - Handle domain-specific terminology

4. Implement POS-tagging to identify parts of speech.

5. Add Named Entity Recognition to identify products, brands, and other entities.

6. Create a pipeline orchestrator to process data in batches.

7. Implement caching mechanisms for processed data.

8. Set up storage of processed results in Supabase.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test text normalization with various input formats and verify output cleanliness.
2. Validate language detection accuracy with multi-language samples.
3. Test tokenization and lemmatization with domain-specific text samples.
4. Verify POS-tagging accuracy against known-good examples.
5. Test Named Entity Recognition with e-commerce specific content.
6. Benchmark processing pipeline performance with large datasets.
7. Verify correct storage of processed results in the database.
