1. Create a Supabase project and set up the required database tables: `scrape_results`, `scrape_jobs`, `users`, and `projects`.
2. Configure Supabase Auth for user authentication and authorization.
3. Set up Supabase Storage for large datasets and exports.
4. Create a Render account and configure Web Service for React frontend.
5. Set up API Service on Render for Express.js backend.
6. Configure Cron Jobs on Render for scheduled scraping tasks.
7. Implement CI/CD pipeline connecting GitHub repository to Render for automatic deployments.
8. Set up environment variables and secrets management.
9. Implement basic logging and monitoring.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify database connection and table creation with test queries.
2. Test authentication flow with sample user registration and login.
3. Upload and retrieve test files from Storage.
4. Confirm successful deployment of minimal frontend and backend applications.
5. Verify Cron Job execution with a simple scheduled task.
6. Test CI/CD pipeline with a minor code change.
7. Ensure proper environment variable access across services.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create and Configure Supabase Project with Database Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new Supabase project and implement the required database schema with proper relationships and access controls.
### Details:
1. Create a new Supabase project through the Supabase dashboard.
2. Design and implement the database schema with the following tables:
   - `users`: Store user information (id, email, name, created_at)
   - `projects`: Store project details (id, name, description, user_id, created_at)
   - `scrape_jobs`: Store scraping job configurations (id, project_id, name, url_pattern, frequency, status, created_at)
   - `scrape_results`: Store scraping results (id, scrape_job_id, data, status, created_at)
3. Set up appropriate relationships between tables (foreign keys).
4. Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure users can only access their own data.
5. Create database indexes for performance optimization.
6. Test the schema by inserting and querying sample data through the Supabase interface.
7. Document the database schema and relationships.

## 2. Implement Supabase Authentication and Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Configure Supabase Auth for user authentication and set up Supabase Storage for handling large datasets and exports.
### Details:
1. Enable and configure Supabase Auth with email/password authentication.
2. Set up OAuth providers if needed (Google, GitHub).
3. Configure email templates for verification, password reset, etc.
4. Create custom user profiles linked to the users table.
5. Set up Supabase Storage buckets:
   - `exports`: For storing generated data exports
   - `datasets`: For storing large scraped datasets
6. Configure appropriate bucket permissions using RLS.
7. Implement test cases for user registration, login, and profile management.
8. Create helper functions for common auth operations (signup, login, password reset).
9. Test file uploads and downloads to/from storage buckets.

## 3. Set Up Render Web Service for Frontend Deployment [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Create and configure a Render Web Service for hosting the React frontend application with proper environment configuration.
### Details:
1. Create a Render account if not already available.
2. Set up a new Web Service on Render for the React frontend.
3. Configure the build settings:
   - Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Start command: `npm start`
   - Node version: Select appropriate version
4. Set up environment variables:
   - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - Other frontend-specific environment variables
5. Configure auto-deploy from the GitHub repository.
6. Set up a custom domain if available.
7. Configure HTTPS and SSL certificates.
8. Test the deployment with a simple React app that connects to Supabase.
9. Set up proper caching and CDN settings for optimal performance.

## 4. Deploy Express.js Backend as Render API Service [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up and configure a Render API Service for the Express.js backend with proper connection to Supabase.
### Details:
1. Create a new API Service on Render for the Express.js backend.
2. Configure the build settings:
   - Build command: `npm install`
   - Start command: `node server.js` (or appropriate entry point)
   - Node version: Select appropriate version
3. Set up environment variables:
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`
   - `JWT_SECRET`
   - Other backend-specific environment variables
4. Configure auto-deploy from the GitHub repository.
5. Set up health check endpoints.
6. Implement basic Express.js server with Supabase connection.
7. Create API routes for authentication and basic data operations.
8. Test the API endpoints using Postman or similar tool.
9. Implement proper error handling and logging middleware.

## 5. Configure Render Cron Jobs and CI/CD Pipeline [pending]
