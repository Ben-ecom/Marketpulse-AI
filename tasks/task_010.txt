# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement End-to-End Testing and Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop comprehensive testing suite and optimize performance across the entire application.
# Details:
1. Implement end-to-end testing suite:
   - Create test scenarios covering core user journeys
   - Set up automated testing with Cypress or similar tool
   - Implement API testing for backend endpoints

2. Perform performance optimization:
   - Identify and resolve frontend performance bottlenecks
   - Optimize database queries and indexing
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Optimize API response times

3. Implement monitoring and logging:
   - Set up error tracking and reporting
   - Implement performance monitoring
   - Create usage analytics

4. Conduct security audits:
   - Perform vulnerability scanning
   - Review authentication and authorization
   - Test for common security issues

5. Implement data compliance measures:
   - Ensure GDPR and CCPA compliance
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Create privacy documentation

6. Prepare deployment pipeline for production.

# Test Strategy:
1. Run end-to-end tests across all core user journeys.
2. Benchmark performance before and after optimization.
3. Test monitoring by simulating errors and performance issues.
4. Verify security with penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.
5. Test compliance features with sample data.
6. Perform load testing to verify scalability.
7. Conduct user acceptance testing with stakeholders.
