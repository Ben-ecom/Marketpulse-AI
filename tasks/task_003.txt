# Title: Develop Platform-Specific Scraping Modules
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create specialized modules for scraping Reddit, Amazon, Instagram/TikTok, and Trustpilot using the Decodo API.
# Details:
1. Develop the Reddit scraping module:
   - Implement functions to navigate subreddits and extract posts/comments
   - Create data structures for storing Reddit-specific data points
   - Add filtering by relevance and date

2. Develop the Amazon Reviews scraping module:
   - Implement functions to navigate product pages and extract reviews
   - Create data structures for storing review data
   - Add filtering by star rating

3. Develop the Instagram/TikTok scraping module:
   - Implement functions to search by hashtags and extract posts/videos
   - Create data structures for storing social media content
   - Handle different media types appropriately

4. Develop the Trustpilot scraping module:
   - Implement functions to navigate company pages and extract reviews
   - Create data structures for storing review data
   - Add filtering by date and rating

5. Create a unified interface for all scraping modules.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test each platform module with sample URLs to verify data extraction.
2. Validate the structure and completeness of extracted data against expected schema.
3. Test filtering mechanisms to ensure they correctly limit data collection.
4. Verify handling of pagination and "load more" functionality.
5. Test error scenarios specific to each platform.
6. Validate the unified interface works consistently across all modules.
7. Perform integration tests combining multiple platform scrapes.
